                    Software Development Resource Pack! Like many of you, I am relatively new to
                    the world of digital innovation, and through my time on Slack have come across
                    some very useful Resources, Tools & Additional supports that have helped me in
                    my journey to date.<br>
                    My name is Anthony and as recently appointed student lead for User Centric Frontend Development, I
                    decided to create a "webspace" dedicated to these supplementary solutions available
                    to me, and now to you!</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">Anna Greaves, a current student on the course we are all on and my predecessor as UCFD Lead, has created an incredible resource on the Bootstrap Grid. I really think Code
                            Institute should consider putting this video in the curriculum, as I know it has helped not only me, but many MANY other students in their understanding of how to navigate the Grid!</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">For the sake of this webspace, I couldn't possibly link the thousands of videos Brad from Traversy Media has made, that would possibly all help us in our journey, but I have linked
                            his Crash Course on CSS3 video for you all to sink you teeth into. (P.S: There is also a HTML5 Crash course video too.)</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">This document was a godsend for me when I was writing my README.md file for my 1st milestone and I'm sure I'll be referencing it again for all the rest of my Milestone projects. The link

                            <p class="li-subtext">Jon Duckett has created an inspirational set of reference material for anyone from the tech-savvy experienced coder to anyone with no coding experience. I bought these within my first week
                            and have read them extensively! From HTML & CSS to Javascript & jQuery you are sure to use these throughout your entire course.</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">If you can think of an element, Bootstrap probably has it, from responsive imagery to dynamic collapsable elements. The documentation is easy to follow
                                and you will be using Bootstrap to structure your Milestone projects to be responsive!</p>

                                deals with start-up, linking to the website and the icons and how to style them to fit the theme/palette of your website!</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">This document write up was found by a fellow student David 'H' Hubber, it is written by Jesse James Garrett and is only one chapter of an even bigger resource. It details the importance of each 
                                of the five planes of User Experience.</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">A quick google search for User Story Examples returned thousands of search results in seconds, the link is on "How to create a good user story". For the smallest piece of work
                                you will create during your README.md write up, it can sometimes be the hardest, give this a good run through and you should be ok to create your own!</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">These documents, of which there are 3, are the go to Gold Star in terms of useful resources. Once again a special thanks to Anna Greaves, my predecessor, on creating such a benchmark
                                of knowledge that we can all use and learn from when we feel a bit lost regarding the direction to take with our projects!</p>
