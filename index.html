                    Software Development Resource Pack! Like many of you, I am relatively new to
                    the world of digital innovation, and through my time on Slack have come across
                    some very useful Resources, Tools & Additional supports that have helped me in
                    my journey to date.<br>
                    My name is Anthony and as recently appointed student lead for User Centric Frontend Development, I
                    decided to create a "webspace" dedicated to these supplementary solutions available
                    to me, and now to you!</p>

                            Institute should consider putting this video in the curriculum, as I know it has helped not only me, but many MANY other students in their understanding of how to navigate the Grid!</p>

                            his Crash Course on CSS3 video for you all to sink your teeth into. (P.S: There is also a HTML5 Crash course video too.)</p>

                                and you will be using Bootstrap to structure your Milestone projects to be responsive!</p>

                                you will create during your README.md write up, it can sometimes be the hardest, give this a good run through and you should be ok to create your own!</p>

                            <p class="li-subtext">These documents, of which there are 3, are the go to Gold Star in terms of useful resources. Once again a special thanks to Anna Greaves, my predecessor, on creating such a benchmark
                                of knowledge that we can all use and learn from when we feel a bit lost regarding the direction to take with our projects!</p>
